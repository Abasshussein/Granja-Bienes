    Ever since the implementation of Granja-Bienes, a lot of changes have happened that changed the social and economic 
    state of the community and general users of the platform in a much positive way.
    We have taken time to find out from some of the web application users on how they have benefited from the application 
    and the following represents what we found:

                I registered, got vetted and as a result of the customer demand i have put up a small green 
                house behind my house to meet the demand by clients.</span>

                come to collect the farm produce as orsered by Granja clients online.
                Kamau has since expanded his green house with the confidence that his produce will
                not go bad on the farm as he has alot of demand from the platform.</p>

              <p> I have been jugling between going to work and doin alot of other earands and as a result have no extra 
                time to go to the market early, and as a result i used to find only stale vegetable. 
                But since i started using Granja-Bienes, i have been happy because its convenient and besides receiving
                fresh produce, i have alot of time do do other things.
