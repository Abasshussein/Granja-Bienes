    Ever since the implementation of Granja-Bienes, a lot of changes have happened that changed the social and economic 
    state of the community and general users of the platform in a much positive way.
    We have taken time to find out from some of the web application users on how they have benefited from the application 
    and the following represents what we found:

              <p> As a small scale farmer in Limuru, ever since i knew about Granja web application, 
                i had alot of orders that have so far made it easier and faster to sell my 
                produce and get paid instantly during the collection of the produce..</p>

              <p> I used to do vegetables on my backyard for personal consumption then a friend of mine 
                informed me about Granja and that if i register i can make money off my produce.
                I registered, got vetted and as a result of the customer demand i have put up a small green 
                house behind my house to meet the demand by clients.</p>
